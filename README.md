# CodSoft Internship (`Python Development`)
I decided to see what the world outside of ALX SE environment looks like, I got the opportunity to intern as a `Python` developer and with **CodSoft** and here
(in this repository) are the projects that I had to build within 4 weeks to get certified.

You are free to contribute to the project after January, 2024, just ensure you read through [CONTRIBUTION.md](./CONTRIBUTION.md) to know how to contribute,
after reading about the particular project of interest.

There were 5 projects in all and I was supposed to get at least 3 of them done within the 4 weeks of internship, but as an [**ALX**](https://www.alxafrica.com/)
brought up, I chose to do them all. I thought it was a great opportunity to stand out, if indeed being an ALX SE student makes one stand out in the tech space.

***The projects were as follows:***

## Task 1: [To-Do List](./to-do_list)
A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a command-line or
GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists

## Task 2: [Calculator](./calculator)
Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. Perform the calculation and display
the result.

## Task 3: [Password Generator](./password_generator)
A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using
Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.

**User Input:** Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.

**Generate Password:** Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.

**Display the Password:** Print the generated password on the screen.

## Task 4: [Rock-Paper-Scissors Game](./rock_paper_scissors)
**User Input:** Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.

**Computer Selection:** Generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.

**Game Logic:** Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
> *Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock*

**Display Result:** Show the user's choice and the computer's choice.
> *Display the result, whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie*

**Score Tracking (Optional):** Keep track of the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.

**Play Again:** Ask the user if they want to play another round.

**User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.

## Task 5: [Contact Book](./contact_book)
**Contact Information:** Store name, phone number, email, and address for each contact.

**Add Contact:** Allow users to add new contacts with their details.

**View Contact List:** Display a list of all saved contacts with names and phone numbers.

**Search Contact:** Implement a search function to find contacts by name or phone number.

**Update Contact:** Enable users to update contact details.

**Delete Contact:** Provide an option to delete a contact.

**User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
